### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

<dl>
	<dt>Who are you?</dt>
	<dd>I am Nathan Patel, a Computer Science undergrad at the University of Bristol.</dd>
	<dt>What are you currently working on?</dt>
	<dd>Lately I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/baconsenpaii/super-lobster">Super Lobster</a>,
	an unholy love child of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge">Befunge</a>
	and <a href="https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html">Piet</a>.</dd>
	<dt>What's the coolest thing you've made?</dt>
	<dd>Probably <a href="https://github.com/baconsenpaii/first-4kb-demo">this 4KB raytracer I made over a month</a>.
	It wasn't the first time I made a raytracer, but it was the first time I tried making a 4KB demo.</dd>
