### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

<dl>
    <dt>Who are you?</dt>
    <dd>I am Nathan Patel, a Computer Science undergrad at the University of Bristol.</dd>
    <dt>What are you currently working on?</dt>
    <dd>
        <a href="https://github.com/baconsenpaii/super-lobster">baconsenpaii/super-lobster</a> &mdash; Super Lobster,
        an unholy love child of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge">Befunge</a>
        and <a href="https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html">Piet</a><br />

    </dd>
    <dt>What's the coolest thing you've made?</dt>
    <dd>
        Probably <a href="https://github.com/baconsenpaii/first-4kb-demo">this 4KB raytracer</a>.
        It wasn't the first time I made a raytracer, but it was the first time I tried making a 4KB demo.
    </dd>
    <dt>What languages do you use?</dt>
    <dd>
        For personal projects? I like Python and C.<br />
        For game jams? Mostly C# and JavaScript.<br />
        For uni work? A lot of Java, with bits of Haskell, C and Go thrown in too.
